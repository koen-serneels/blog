Today not a technical entry, but a small announcement. The book I wrote together with Marten Deinum is finally out! I got my copy yesterday and it looks rather good, if I say so myself:-)

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012-07-17-pro-spring-mvc-with-web-flow/book-large.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/2012-07-17-pro-spring-mvc-with-web-flow/book-small.jpg"/></a></div>

The chapters I wrote:

<ul>
	<li>Testing Spring MVC applications</li>
	<li>Spring Web Flow</li>
	<li>Building applications with Spring Web Flow</li>
	<li>Advanced Spring Web Flow</li>
	<li>Spring Security</li>
</ul>

I started writing on it around half December, the final touch (at least by us, authors) was made somewhere half June. I never expected that writing would be so difficult, it was quite a challenge. What I originally estimated as four weeks of work (two weeks full-time during vacation time and two weeks only evenings, after normal working hours) turned out to be almost five months! Writing good quality software is difficult, but writing content for a book is an even greater challenge.

At the end it was quite an interesting experience to go through the entire development cycle of a book. It was also a good learning path for the technology itself. Even though I have been working a long time with these technologies, it still took a lot of investigation to be able to write adequately about it.

Anyway, if you are doing front-end work with Spring MVC, Web Flow2 or are intrigued by these technologies, go take a look! The book is available on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Spring-MVC-Professional-Apress/dp/1430241551/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1338819839&sr=8-1">Amazon</a>  or directly from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apress.com/9781430241553">Apress</a>.

Happy reading!
